blog"},"https://joao-vitor-sr.github.io/overview-linear-algebra/":{"body":"In recent years, linear models have become quite famous. And have assumed very\nimportant roles in almost all the physical and social sciences, and as\nexpected, this has stimulated the growth in the interest in linear algebra.\nThe article that you're reading has the intent that even if you don't\nunderstand anything about linear algebra, at least understand what it's and\nwhy it's useful. I don't intend to explain all computations and proofs behind\nthe models, so if you're searching for something more complete, this is not\nthe place for you (good luck with your search 😀)\nVectors\nWe can say that the foundation of linear models is the vector, so it's good to\nunderstand what it's and why it's so important.\nIn the mathematical world, we have three main distinct approaches to what's a\nvector. There is the computer science perspective, the physics, and the purely\nmathematical one.\nPhysics perspective\nFrom the perspective of physics, a vector is an arrow in space. That contains\ntwo properties magnitude, and direction, and its dimension can be\ntwo-dimensional or three (on mathematical computation, it's possible to have\nvectors on the fourth dimension, but since we cannot understand this dimension\nat its full potential, the definition of this dimension is purely\nmathematical).\nMany physical quantities are vectors, and it's interesting how the same rule\nof operations applies to all of them.\nGenerally, a vector may originate from any point in space and end at any other.\nComputer science perspective\nIn this perspective, vectors are a list of numbers with a length of n (this\nrepresents the size of the list). The order matters.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 &amp; 3 &amp; 5\n\\end{pmatrix} \\mathrel{\\char`≠} \\begin{pmatrix}\n3 &amp; 1 &amp; 5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nMathematical Perspective\nAnd finally, we have the mathematical approach, which remembers the physical\nnotion, but with some differences.\nFirst of all, the vectors are not dependent on space, so it's possible to have\nany n-dimensional vector without limits, and it's also similar to the CS\nperspective, that it's a list of numbers.\nMatrices\nWith the definition of the vector clear, we can keep forward to the matrix\ndefinition.\nThis definition provides a powerful tool. A matrix is a rectangular array of\nnumbers arranged into rows and columns.\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na_{1,1} &amp; a_{1,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{1,n} \\\\\na_{2,1} &amp; a_{2,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{2,n} \\\\\n\\vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; \\vdots \\\\\na_{m,1} &amp; a_{m,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{m,n}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nIt's an m by n (it's written as m x n) matrix. Matrices don't have numerical\nvalues. Instead, it's a way to manage tables of numbers. A double subscript\nrepresents any one of its elements. By convention, the first subscript is the\nrow, and the second one is the column, so the following equation represents a\nvalue from matrix A, that's at row 1 and column 2\n$$\na_{1,2}\n$$\nExamples\nHere is a small colection of matrices\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &amp; 0 \\\\\n0 &amp; 1\n\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\na_{1,1} &amp; a_{1,2} \\\\\na_{2,1} &amp; a_{2,2}\n\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\na &amp; b \\\\\nc &amp; d\n\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &amp; 2 &amp; 4 \\\\\n\\lambda &amp; \\beta &amp; \\alpha\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nIt's possible to have different numbers of rows and columns (the\nfourth matrix is an example, with two rows and three columns)\nOperations\nEven if a matrix is just a collection of numbers (arrays/tables) still is\npossible to do operations, most of which will be similar to the traditional\nones. However, some require a \"special\" focus since they can be different.\nEquality\nA matrix is said to be equal only if all elements are equal\n(this applies to the size too).\nExamples:\n$$\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &amp; 0 \\\\\n0 &amp; 1\n\\end{bmatrix}, B = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &amp; 1 \\\\\n0 &amp; 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nA is different from B, since the elements values are different\n$$\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &amp; 4 &amp; 7 \\\\\n8 &amp; 1 &amp; 2\n\\end{bmatrix}, B = \\begin{bmatrix}\n5 &amp; \\lambda \\\\\n\\beta &amp; 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThey are not equal, since the size is different, and therefore values are also\n$$\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 &amp; 8 \\\\\n9 &amp; 1\n\\end{bmatrix}, B = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 &amp; 8 \\\\\n9 &amp; 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nHere the matrices are equal, because the size is the same, and all elemnts have\nthe same value\nMultiplication by scalar\nGiven a matrix \\(A\\) and a scalar \\(\\lambda\\) the product of \\(\\lambda\\)\nand \\(A\\) written \\(\\lambda A \\) is\n$$\n\\lambda A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\lambda a_{1,1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\lambda a_{1,n} \\\\\n\\lambda a_{2,1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\lambda a_{2,n} \\\\\n\\vdots  &amp; &amp; \\vdots \\\\\n\\lambda a_{m, 1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\lambda a_{m, n}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nEach element of A is multiplied by the scalar (in this case \\(\\lambda\\)), and\nthe product will be a matrix m X n\nExamples:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lambda = 2, &amp;&amp; A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n4 &amp; 7 \\\\\n8 &amp; 9\n\\end{bmatrix} &amp;&amp; \\lambda A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n8 &amp; 14 \\\\\n16 &amp; 18\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\\\\\n\\lambda = -4, &amp;&amp; A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &amp; 2 \\\\\n0 &amp; 1\n\\end{bmatrix}, &amp;&amp; \\lambda A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-4 &amp; -8 \\\\\n0 &amp; -4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nAddition\nThe sum C of a matrix A having m rows and n columns and a matrix B having m rows\nand n columns is a matrix having m rows and n columns.\nIn addition, there's a sum in each element\nExamples:\nThe sum\n$$\nC = A + B\n$$\nExpands to\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nC &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix}\nc_{1,1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; c_{1,n} \\\\\n\\vdots &amp; &amp; \\vdots \\\\\nc_{m,1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; c_{m,n}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\na_{1,1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{1,n} \\\\\n\\vdots &amp; &amp; \\vdots \\\\\na_{m,1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{m,n}\n\\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix}\nb_{1,1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; b_{1,n} \\\\\n\\vdots &amp; &amp; \\vdots \\\\\nb_{m,1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; b_{m,n}\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n&amp;= \\begin{bmatrix}\na_{1,1} + b_{1,1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{1,n} + b_{1,n} \\\\\n\\vdots &amp; &amp; \\vdots \\\\\na_{m,1} + b_{m,1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{m,n} + b_{m,n}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nIf the number of rows or columns is different between the matrices, the\noperation is said to be undefined.\nNote that the addition is commutative (which in linear algebra is not always\ntrue for all operations)\n$$\nA + B = B + A,\nA + (B + C) = (A + B) + C = A + B + C\n$$\nSubtraction\nThe subtraction is defined to be the sum of two matrices, but the matrix that\nis subtracting is pre-multiplied by -1, as an example:\n$$\nA - B = A + (-1) B\n$$\nMatrix multiplication\nThink of a way to multiply two matrices. You can try to do something similar\nto sum, multiplying each element with its equivalent on the other matrix.\nSo try to ponder a little and think of a way to multiply two different\nmatrices, even when the rows and columns lengths are equal.\nBecause of this, matrix multiplication is not equal to \"traditional\" matrix\noperations. (this is not the unique reason)\nSo the operation of the multiplication is in this way.\nOperation\nThe operation is related to the row of matrix A and the column of\nmatrix B, as an example:\n$$\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &amp; 3 \\\\\n2 &amp; 4\n\\end{bmatrix}, B = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 &amp; 1 \\\\\n3 &amp; 5\n\\end{bmatrix}, C = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1(2) + 3(3) &amp; 1(1) + 3(5) \\\\\n2(2) + 4(3) &amp; 2(1) + 4(5)\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n11 &amp; 16 \\\\\n16 &amp; 22\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nAs you can see, the first row multiplies the second column, and finally, there\nis a sum of the elements.\n$$\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n3 &amp; 2 \\\\\n6 &amp; 1\n\\end{bmatrix}, B = \\begin{bmatrix}\n4 \\\\\n5\n\\end{bmatrix}, C = \\begin{bmatrix}\n3(4) + 2(5) \\\\\n6(4) + 1(5)\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n22 \\\\\n29\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe matrix C is m X r when A is m X n, and B k X r. The resulting matrix has\nthe same number of rows as the first matrix and the same number of columns as\nthe second one.\nRemember that the multiplication is not always commutative since not always\nthe rules of the rows and columns sizes are applied, see:\n$$\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 &amp; 1 \\\\\n3 &amp; 1\n\\end{bmatrix}, B = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}, AB = \\begin{bmatrix}\n5 \\\\\n7\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nHowever, BA is undefined since the number of columns in B is not the same as\nthe number of rows in A\nLinear dependence\nLinear dependence or independence are properties of the set of vectors, not the\nindividual vectors.\nA set is said to be a dependency, \\( (a_1, \\cdots, a_m) \\) from \\(E^n\\)\nis said to be dependent if there is some scalar (not all zeros), that\n$$\n\\lambda_1 a_1 + \\lambda_2 a_2 + \\cdots + \\lambda_m a_m = 0\n$$\nor in other words, there is a set (in En)En) that when multiplied by a scalar.\nBasis Vectors\nUntil now, we were working with vector coordinates, but instead, think of each\ncoordinate as a scalar and think about how they change the space. The number\nthat those scalars modify is the basis vector.\nWith this in mind, think of vector coordinates as scalars that modify the\nbasis vectors.\nWith this definition, it's possible to have a different basis. And at the same\ntime, still, be possible to reach all points in space just by changing the\nscalars.\nLinear transformations\nIt is not uncommon to apply transformations in a set of values. However,\nlinear models use a special kind of transformation called linear.\nAn example, \\(Y = Ax\\) is a linear transformation, that moves x points to\nother points in space.\nIt's possible to say the values of Y are the same as x, but after that, matrix\nA transformed the points on x.\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_1 = Ax_1, &amp; &amp; y_2 = Ax_2 \\\\\ny_1 + y_2 &amp;= Ax_1 + Ax_2 &amp;= A(x_1 + x_2)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe technical definition is.\nA linear transformation T on the space \\(E^n\\) is a correspondence that maps\neach vector x of \\(E^n\\) into a vector T(x) of \\(E^m\\), such that\n$$\nT({\\lambda}_1 x_1 + {\\lambda}_2 + x_2) = {\\lambda}_1 T(x_1) + {\\lambda}_2T(x_2)\n$$\nThis equation preserves addition and multiplication by a scalar\nAny matrix transformation is a linear transformation since all rules apply to\nmatrices\nExamples:\nLinear:\n$$\nT({\\lambda}_1 x_1 + {\\lambda}_2 x_2) = a({\\lambda}_1 x_1 + {\\lambda}_2 x_2) =\n{\\lambda}_1(ax_1) + {\\lambda}_2(ax_2) = {\\lambda}_1 T(x_1) + {\\lambda}_2 T(x_2)\n$$\nIt's linear, but the following one is not linear.\n$$\nT(\\lambda_1 x_1 + \\lambda_2 x_2) = a(\\lambda_1 x_1 + \\lambda_2 x_2)^2 =\na(\\lambda_1 x_1)^2 + a(\\lambda_2 x_2)^2 + 2a\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 x_1 x_2\n$$\nSo this equation is not linear and therefore is not a valid transformation.\nDeterminant\nA determinant is defined to be the number computed from\nthe following sum. Involving the \\(n^2\\) elements in A\n$$\n|A| = \\sum (\\pm) a_{1,i}, a_{2,j}, \\cdots, a_{n,r}\n$$\nA sum sign is added if \\( (i,j,\\cdots,r) \\) is an even permutation of\n\\( (1,2,\\cdots,n) \\) and a minus if it's an odd permutation.\nIn other words, a determinant can the numerical representation of a matrix,\nrepresenting how much this matrix modifies the space. (I will not cover the\ncomputation)\nRank\nThe rank is defined to be the dimension of the matrix, so a 2 X 2 matrix, that\nwhen represented graphically, the result fills the n dimension.\nIt's the maximum number of linearly independent columns in A\nConclusion\nAs you can see, linear algebra is a very deep branch of mathematics and has\nmany implementations in the sciences nowadays.\n","id":"https://joao-vitor-sr.github.io/overview-linear-algebra/","title":"Overview over linear algebra"}},"docInfo":{"https://joao-vitor-sr.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://joao-vitor-sr.github.io/introduction/":{"body":27,"title":2},"https://joao-vitor-sr.github.io/overview-linear-algebra/":{"body":1116,"title":4}},"length":3},"lang":"English"};
